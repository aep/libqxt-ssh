==============LINUX====================


./configure --help
./configure 
make 
sudo make install

to get the docs into assistant type:
assistant -addContentFile /usr/share/doc/libqxt/index.dcf


to use it in a project:
add CONFIG+=qxt
to your .pro file
QXT=core kit etc...  
will add the modules to your project





==============WINDOWS-mingw====================



./configure.bat
make 
make install

to get the docs into assistant type:
assistant -addContentFile C:\libqxt\doc\libqxt\index.dcf


to use it in a project:
add CONFIG+=qxt
to your .pro file
QXT=core kit etc...
will add the modules to your project






==============WINDOWS-msvc====================
(you could try  ./configure.bat -msvc and open 
the solution file in msvc, we recomend compiling on
commandline though)

./configure.bat   
nmake 
nmake install

to get the docs into assistant type:
assistant -addContentFile C:\libqxt\doc\libqxt\index.dcf


to use it in a project:
add CONFIG+=qxt
to your .pro file
QXT=core kit etc...
will add the modules to your project


if you have an existing msvc project and can't swtich to qmake you use zbenjamins solution:

     Howto use libqxt in a existing Visual Studio Project:
      1.  create and install libqxt. (See install instructions)
      2.  add {libqxtinstalldir}\include\qxt\qxt to your include path
      3.  add {libqxtinstalldir}\lib to your library search path
      4.  to add a specific libqxt module (f.e QxtSql) you have to:
           - add {libqxtinstalldir}\include\qxt\QxtSql to your include path
           - add the library QxtSql.lib to your project
          Most of the times you have also to include the QxtCore and QxtKit modules.
          It's done the same way like the example above.
