				Intention

In case LGPL is not legal in your country,
the LGPL becomes invalid, somone goes mad, somone is trying 
to abuse a mistake in the LGPL, whatever goes wrong,
we don't want our work lost. So this is a kind of fallback in 
case whatever goes wrong with the legal things. Remember that the 
legal agreement is still the LGPL and that forking libqxt into a difference license 
should never happen. Also this is not a legal text made for lawyers, we just want to 
state our intention in colloquial speech.

The Contributers of libqxt are mainly people comming from the hacker scene,
they are into Linux and the idea of open source software.

- We want you to respect their background of open source 
  and not use their code for any purpose that stands against the 
  Freedom of Software.
  Example:

       - You can not own parts of this code. The owner is the comunity.

       - The DRM (Digital Rights Management) is the complete oposite of 
         the idea of Free Software. It trys to restrict a user and dominate
         an economic distribution channel.

- We want everyone to have access to the the source without limits.
  If you are distributing a compiled binary make sure that the user 
  can access the source and modify the library.
  Example:

       - It is ok to link closed source software against libqxt
         as long as you assure the user of your software can modify
         libqxt in the terms of open source. Means you have to share 
         the source of libqxt if the user wants it, including any changes
         you made. But this does not affect your closed source program.

- We dont want to any of our contributions including our names to be
  part of any political or semi-political propaganda.
- We want to be credited for our work.
- This Code is distributed "as is" . There is no Waranty
